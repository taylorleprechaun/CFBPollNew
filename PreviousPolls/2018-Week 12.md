#### Observations and Notes

* Notable Absences: Washington (#28), Boston College (#29), Texas (#33)

* Not much else to report this week.  Biggest thing I noticed with the poll is a lot of 70%+ win percentage G5 teams occupying the 11-25 area of the poll (9/15 spots) rather than the above average P5 teams (like you would see in the AP Poll).  I have the poll valuing winning fairly high, so this makes sense.  If I lower the effect of win percentage to about half of what it is, then the top of the poll (top 10) remains largely unchanged, but the rest (11-25) fills out with mainly P5 teams (12/15) with about a 60% win percentage and strong schedule, which makes sense since SoS plays an important part in the poll.  The effect of win percentage should probably be tweaked just a bit to balance this out (so it doesn't swing too far in either direction).
