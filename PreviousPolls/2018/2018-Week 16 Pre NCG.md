#### Observations and Notes

* Texas is BACK!!!  No longer a notable absence!

* My poll still views Notre Dame as being a step above OSU, Oklahoma, and UGA, even after losing to Clemson in the CFP.

* Something I immediately noticed was LSU above UF (given I am a UF alum).  It seems that bowl season pushed their SoS up enough to put them just ahead of UF (they are only 6% apart).  Maybe head-to-head needs to get factored in for adjacent teams... not sure how I'll adjust that.  A project for this long offseason.
