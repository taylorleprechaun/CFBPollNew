#### Observations and Notes

* And your playoff teams are.......... Ohio State, LSU, Clemson, and *checks notes* Memphis?  Yes that is right, apparently.  Memphis just barely edges out Oklahoma.  Memphis with a slight advantage in strength of schedule, Oklahoma with a small advantage on offensive and defensive stats, and Memphis gets a final bump from turnover margin.  So congrats to Memphis on their playoff appearance!

* Notable teams missing: #26 Iowa, #28 Virginia, #29 USC

* Also special shout out to sports-reference for the team stat tables disappearing until I wrote them, delaying my poll until today
