#### Observations and Notes

* To start with, I was lazy and didn't run this until 11/1 before any games were played that day.  As a result, any games from 10/30-31 have been included in the polls (i.e. 8-1 Buffalo), so this week's poll is a little messed up.

* Once again, I need to get better stats for the rankings.

* The poll seems to be valuing wins just a bit too much, even with my SoS metric trying to weigh it.  As a result, many of the better G5 teams are getting pushed higher up than I feel they should.  i.e. Georgia Southern at #23 when Sagarin and S&P+ have them at 80 and 61, respectively.

* Notable Absences: Texas (#40)
