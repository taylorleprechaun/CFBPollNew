#### Observations and Notes

* Bro, didn't LSU like *just* beat Georgia?  Yes, yes they did.  I need to look into that, but I have a suspicion of what caused it.  Regardless, the poll needs a way to account for head-to-head results for teams close to each other, which I will definitely procrastinate doing.

* Appalachian State at #13?  My poll likes them I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

* Where are Washington, Washington State, Oregon, etc.?  Those teams are sitting at #34, #30, and #28.  Washington is hurt by their record, the latter two are hurt by their strength of schedules.

* I still need to use better stats.  PF, PA, YF, and YA are not very good stats to use to begin with, and I need to replace them with something better (which is resilient to garbage time).

* Texas at #24?  I'm completely stumped by this one, to be honest.  At first I thought it was due to their low average margin of victory (7.71), but Notre dame, a very comparable team (with the stats I am using), is 25% higher than them in the poll with an average margin of victory nearly twice that (13.86).
