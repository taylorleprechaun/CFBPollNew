#### Observations and Notes (Updated 12/14/2020)

* ~~The lack of non-con is really messing with my poll but it is what it is.  Hopefully it'll sort out more as more games get played.~~
* My poll remains messed up going into the conference championships.  Unfortunately the lack of OOC makes it look like trash.  It hopefully will sort itself out (for the most part) after bowl season but until then it is what it is.
