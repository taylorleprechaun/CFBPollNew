#### Observations and Notes

* I am genuinely surprised that LSU is still behind Ohio State.  Looking at the stats I use to rank teams it is pretty obvious.  Both are unbeaten and Ohio State has LSU beat in just about every major stat that is part of my rankings.

* Somehow just like last year UF is just behind a team they beat.  Bruh

* Notable teams missing:  #28 Texas, #37 Utah
