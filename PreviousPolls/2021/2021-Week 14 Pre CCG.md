#### Observations and Notes (Updated 11/28/2021)

* I put in some dummy scores using my predicted scores (see below) and based on those predictions my system is predicting Georgia, Oklahoma State, Michigan, and Cincinnati as the top 4
* I also messed around with the combinations of wins/losses for each team.  The way I messed with the combinations was really basic (just flip the predicted scores around) and depending on the actual outcomes of the games the results could be a little off.  I also found that the ACC championship and Pac-12 championship didn't change the results of the top 4 so I didn't include those combinations.  For the full output refer to: [combinations](https://github.com/taylorleprechaun/CFBPollNew/blob/master/PreviousPolls/2021-Week%2014%20Scenarios.xlsx)
