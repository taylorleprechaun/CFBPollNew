Wrapping up the 2021 (regular) season:

In the few weeks this has been running it's been doing alright.  There are some improvements I have in mind for this that I plan to implement and "test" over the offseason.  For the current season I've predicted 57 games (picking games from the current week that look interesting to me).

In those 57 games the algorithm has gone 41-16 (.719) on outright picks, 26-25 against the spread (.510), and 23-30 (.434) on the over/under.  I'm pretty happy with the outright picks but there's tweaks I want to make which I think will improve it and as a result improve the ATS result.  The over/under, however, is a different story.

I noticed a couple weeks ago my algorithm picks the Over a lot... like way too much.  In 57 games it picked Over on about 68% of them.  The actual outcome of the games was Over on about 44% of them.  My initial thoughts on this were two things: 1) I have ideas to improve the algorithm so maybe that will fix the issue and 2) I think my home field advantage system is shifting the combined scores too high.  I just do a blanket HomeTeam+3 thing in the prediction since generally speaking home field advantage is about 3 points.  If I take all my predictions and remove 3 points from the total, it shifts to picking over about 39% of the time but only a marginal increase in results (43% -> 48%).  As I update my prediction algorithm I need to keep this in mind.
