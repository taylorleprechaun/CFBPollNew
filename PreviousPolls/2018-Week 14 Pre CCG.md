#### Observations and Notes

* Notable Absences: West Virginia (#27), Texas (#30)

* My poll really hates Texas.

* The drop-off from #5 to #6 is quite noticeable.  If I had to guess, my top four following the conference championship games (assuming the higher ranked team wins) will be Clemson, Alabama, Notre Dame, and Central Florida.  Oklahoma's defense and Ohio State's strength of schedule are pulling them down and I'm not sure if the extra win will give either team enough of a boost.
