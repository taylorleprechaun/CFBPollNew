#### Observations and Notes

* More data still helping but also still a bit funky rankings.  There are a lot of big changes week to week so far (i.e. Georgia going from #52 to #13 and Notre Dame dropping from #1 to #37 as a result of their game, Navy doing nothing and going from #23 to #4, etc.).  I have no doubt this will smooth out by week 6-7, as my last season's rankings didn't have as many large changes week in and week out.

* Notable teams missing:  #27 Oklahoma, #30 Texas, #37 Notre Dame
