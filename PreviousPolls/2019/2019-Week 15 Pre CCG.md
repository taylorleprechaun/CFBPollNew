#### Observations and Notes

* Notable teams missing: #27 Virginia
* Here we are before championship weekend with a lot of teams on the outside looking in.  Instead of doing write-ups this week for what separates them, I'm going to run scenarios for the conference championship games to see who gets in to the Playoff under what scenarios.  Any scenarios I ran involving Memphis' or Boise State's game results messed up the scenarios I wanted to run a bit because one of them would always be sliding in in the 4 spot.  So these scenarios were only run with made up P5 CCG results since neither Memphis or Boise really have a shot at the Playoff.  Anyway, here are the scenarios for the Playoff contenders (the full list of scenarios can be found in the Previous Polls folder):

Team | In | Out | What Happens
---|---|---|---
Ohio State | 32 | 0 | Always In
LSU | 32 | 0 | Always In
Clemson | 28 | 4 | Out with loss and Georgia and Oklahoma both win (4)
Georgia | 16 | 16 | In with win, out with loss (16)
Oklahoma | 12 | 20 | In with win and Clemson loss (8).  In with win and Clemson win and Georgia loss (4)
Utah | 4 | 28 | In with win and Georgia and Baylor both lose (4)
Baylor | 4 | 28 | In with win and Georgia and Utah both lose (4)
