#### Observations and Notes

* Clemson takes the top spot over Bama mainly because of their defense.  Bama giving up nearly 75 yards per game more is hurting them.  A way to measure garbage time stats should help this... not sure where/how to get that information.

* Texas Tech at #9?  Yep, you read that right.  Their offense puts up some big yards, and their strength of schedule (.77) and strength of victory (.88) are high as well.  I believe my TODOs in the code mention switching my SoS formula to one similar to the old BCS system (which includes opponent's opponent's records), a change which would mitigate this issue.

* Notre Dame only at #10?  They have the opposite problem Texas Tech has.  Their SoS and SoV *should* be higher, yet they are .57 and .69, respectively.  Perhaps the SoS fix should be my top priority.

Notable Absences: Wisconsin (#27, hurt by SoS/SoV issue) and Texas (#32, hurt by MoV)
