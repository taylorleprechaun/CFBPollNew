#### Observations and Notes

* Okay, now we're getting somewhere.  Poll is starting to look real legit now.  Recent changes introduced some stats which are new to the poll.

* So the big thing is Clemson over Bama.  The poll sees them as very similar, the biggest difference coming from my strength of schedule metric.

* Ohio State at #16?  Once again, strength of schedule knocks a team down.  Teams around them like Utah State, Buffalo, and Fresno State have similarly ranked schedules, which is why they are all so close.  They should pull ahead in the remaining weeks of the season.

* Notable absences: Penn State (#27), Washington (#29), Texas (#42).
