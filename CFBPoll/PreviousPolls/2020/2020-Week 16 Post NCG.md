#### Observations and Notes (Updated 1/12/2021)

* In the end, bowl season did definitely help my poll but a single data point for 50 teams isn't enough to help fix it.  Oh well.  Hopefully next season goes better.  See you all either next season or some time before then with a little update for this poll.  Go Gators!
* Additions to BOAT and WOAT!  (Down below in the section for it)
