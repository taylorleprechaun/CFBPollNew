#### Observations and Notes (Updated 1/14/2020)

* Ohio State above Clemson is expected by my poll given how far ahead of them they were before each team took a loss.  I mentioned it last season that maybe something to compare head-to-head results could be useful but I decided against it then and I'm still against it now.  I'm willing to stick with what my computer says based on the formula and not mess with the standings afterwards.

* I'm also not surprised by how many G5 schools are ranked (9) given a big factor of my poll is winning the games you play.  It is definitely more than the AP (7 - Final, 6 - Week 16), Coaches (6 - Week 16), or CFP (4 - Week 16) rankings have in theirs.

* See you all next fall!  Go Gators!
