#### Observations and Notes (Updated 9/25/2022)

* Still got some early season funk in there but it's smoothing out as these things usually do. Once we're out of the early weeks of the season I'm going to tweak how the early season adjustments work because I'm not very happy with it atm.
* James Madison was near the top last week and now they've just dropped out of the top 25 which is odd. I'm wondering if some of the junk in my rating code handling early season adjustments was having trouble with them not having existed in my poll before this season. I'm in progress on some changes to how the code functions (which aren't in place yet, just laying the foundation to switch to them and then nuke some old code) so I'll probably look into this a bit when I get further along there.
