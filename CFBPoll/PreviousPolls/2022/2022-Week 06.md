#### Observations and Notes (Updated 10/3/2022)

* We've reached the point in the season where my ratings are mostly based on current season information (early season is adjusted using the previous season with less influence week to week). Things look okay here. My poll has always favored winning your games as one of the top things it cares about so it makes sense seeing some teams where they are
* I'm a bit surprised Clemson is #1 by as much as they are but looking into the rating factors on the back-end it makes some sense. I'm even more surprised to see Wake Forest so high up given the fact that they have a loss (even if it's to Clemson). Their overall adjusted strength of schedule is crazy high though (3rd highest of all the teams so far; Stanford, Georgia Tech) which is definitely pushing them up higher
