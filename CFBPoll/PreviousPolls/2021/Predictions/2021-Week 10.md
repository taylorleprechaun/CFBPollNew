Some of these margins are pretty crazy.  I'm torn on if I want to update this section mid-week with my predictions or just do it next week using closing odds when I update this like I did this week.  No one is using this to make bets (and I strongly advise against it if you are thinking about it) but betting information can be inferred just by looking at the predicted scores so there's no real advantage to updating it mid-week.  Leaning towards just updating it every Sunday when I update my poll.

As for last week, let's see how we did:

* 4-2 against the spread (UM/MSU, PSU/OSU)
* 2-3 on the O/U

Not bad
