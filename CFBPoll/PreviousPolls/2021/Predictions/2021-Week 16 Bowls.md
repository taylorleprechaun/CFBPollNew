Bowl Season:

* 20-16 on outright picks
* 14-20 against the spread
* 19-16 on the O/U

I didn't notice Marshall-Louisiana-Lafayette predicted at 25-25.  I re-ran the predictor with more decimal places and it had Marshall winning by 0.1.  Crazy

I don't take too much stock in bowl game prediction results.  Many teams with no coach, players opting out, etc. are things my algorithm can't account for that massively influence the results.

Rescheduled games I couldn't predict until after they were played because I was on vacation:
